# PowerBI-Dashboard-Project

Overview:
  This dashboard analyzes hospital patient data, focusing on:

Inpatients: Patients staying in the hospital during treatment.
Outpatients: Patients treated and discharged the same day.
Key insights include specialty-level performance, patient age profiles, and inpatient vs. outpatient trends.

Challenges and Learnings:
  While creating this dashboard, I encountered several challenges that taught me valuable skills:

  Column Name Mismatches: Learned the importance of consistent naming conventions to ensure smooth data loading and integration.
  Data Cleaning: Understood how missing or duplicate data can impact analysis and mastered Power Query transformations to address these issues.
  Data Model Optimization: Learned to structure relationships between tables for better performance and accurate insights.
  
Features:
  Specialty-wise patient distribution and trends.
  Age group analysis for inpatients and outpatients.
  Interactive visuals with drill-down capabilities.
